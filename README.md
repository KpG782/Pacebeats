Welcome to **PaceBeats**, a mobile application built using **React Native (Expo)** that dynamically recommends music based on your running pace and heartbeat. Powered by real-time IoT integration and hybrid recommendation algorithms, PaceBeats enhances your workout experience by syncing the perfect beat to your stride. 🏃‍♂️❤️🎶

### Prerequisites
- **Visual Studio Code/ Webstorm** for IDEs  
- **Expo CLI** (`npm install -g expo-cli`)  
- Android Studio or Xcode (for emulators)  
- Galaxy Watch 5, 6, 7 or Smartwatch with HealthConnect

## 🎧 What Is PaceBeats and How It Works

PaceBeats is a React Native app that reads your steps, GPS and heart rate in real time and uses a hybrid AI-inspired algorithm to pick the perfect tracks for your run:

1. Calibration  
   - Run a fixed distance (eg. 20 m) to compute your stride length.

2. Sensor Input  
   - Every interval, read step count delta, GPS distance delta and current heart rate.

3. Pace Computation  
   - raw_pace = seconds elapsed ÷ (meters covered ÷ 1000) → sec/km  
   - if GPS jump <10 m, fall back on steps × stride_length.

4. Smoothing  
   - Feed raw_pace into a 1D Kalman filter to remove jitter and get smooth_pace.

5. Bucket Mapping  
   - Convert smooth_pace to minutes/km  
   - Assign to one of six buckets: easy_walk, recovery, cruise, tempo, interval, sprint.

6. Nearest-BPM Recommendation  
   - For current bucket, compute |track.bpm − bucket_center| for all tracks  
   - Sort by bpm_diff and pick top 5.

7. Playback & Logging  
   - Show titles, BPM, duration; let runner select or auto-play best match  
   - Log timestamp, raw and smooth pace, bucket, heart rate, track info to CSV.

That’s it. No fluff, just your pace feeding straight into your playlist. Download, clone, install and let PaceBeats handle the rest.
